# Intergreted Financial Dataset

# 1. Executive Summary 
Predicting movements in stock prices can provide values for investment and risk management. Recent advancements in data science and machine learning offer the potential to enhance stock price predictions by integrating diverse data sources. This dataset aims to generate a landscape of the US stock market and economy movement, and provide a solid background for further modeling to help people make strategic decisions.

# 2. Description of data

# 3. Power analysis results
To study the correlation between the stock dataset and economic indicators, the power analysis is performed using alpha=0.5 (Type I error) and power=0.9 (for Type II error) and effect size is 0.3 and the correlation is using Cohen's d for correlation ((M1-M2)/SD). The code for finding sample size is as follows:
```python
# generated by GenAI
import statsmodels.api as sm
def calculate_sample_size(effect_size, alpha=0.05, power=0.9):
    # Calculate the required sample size for a correlation test
    required_sample_size = sm.stats.NormalIndPower().solve_power(
        effect_size, alpha=alpha, power=power, alternative='two-sided'
    )
    return int(required_sample_size)
# (Cohen's d for correlation)
effect_size = 0.3  # medium effect
sample_size = calculate_sample_size(effect_size)
print(f"Required sample size for correlation study: {sample_size}")
```
The result is 233, which means at least 233 data points must to obtained to meet the requirement.
